# SimBoard Backend

The backend is a FastAPI service that ingests simulation archives, stores normalized metadata in PostgreSQL, and exposes the `/api/v1` REST API used by the frontend and service-account tooling.

## Responsibilities

- archive ingestion and validation
- case, simulation, machine, and ingestion persistence
- GitHub OAuth and API-token authentication
- PACE execution lookup
- API schemas and routing
